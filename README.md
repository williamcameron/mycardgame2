Beginnings of TDD Card Game

Based on Pokemon TCG - [Rules](http://assets.pokemon.com//assets/cms2/pdf/trading-card-game/rulebook/sm1_rulebook_en.pdf).

All rules, names, logic, images, mechanics and anything that isn't mine copyright and trademark Hasbro.   This is purely a hobby project and not intended to upset anyone :) (Just saying).

Building up using BDD and TDD methodologies to work from cards in decks and slowly introduce mechanics and rules as we go along.
